Through-Cloud-Code
==================

__Description:__  

Through is an iPhone application that simplify the way you browse photos on social networks. Connect your Twitter and Facebook accounts and see all your photos in one place.

__Source Code:__  

Through shut down. This was a little experiment to build something cool on top of third party APIs, but it didn't work well at the end, nevertheless I had a great time building the app. Hopefully someone will find something useful here and I always appreciate feedback.  

[Android](https://github.com/Ruenzuo/Through-Android) and [iOS](https://github.com/Ruenzuo/Through-iOS) versions source code are also open source.

__Please note:__

All the API keys are not working anymore, so I didn't bother to remove those from the repository. Also, please read the [license](https://github.com/Ruenzuo/Through-Cloud-Code/blob/master/License) and don't be a jackass.
